# CS1520 Project 1

## Goal:

To gain experience building interactive web applications through the use of
JavaScript and React.

## High-level description:

You will be using React to implement the game of Battleship to be played with
the web browser. For this version, you will assume that only one user is viewing
the page that presents your game at a time ("hotseat" multiplayer, e.g., the two
players are using a laptop that they pass back and forth between turns). Details
of the game can be found here:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship\_(game)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>)
Your game will be built on a 10x10 grid, with rows labeled 1-10 and columns
labeled A-J. We will assume that players will place 3 game pieces: an
aircraft carrier (5 spaces long), a battleship (4 spaces long), and a submarine
(3 spaces long). These pieces can be placed either horizontally or
vertically.

## Specifications:

1. When the page is loaded, your game should begin by asking the first player
   for their name (for example, lets assume that the first player is Alice), and a
   string representing their ship placements.
   - Your game should accept strings of the following form (with this example
     resulting in an aircraft carrier placed on A1, A2,
     A3, A4, A5; a battleship at B6, C6, D6, E6; and a submarine at H3, I3,
     J3):
     - `A(A1-A5);B(B6-E6);S(H3-J3);`

1. After gathering the first player's name and ship placement, your game should
   ask the second player for their name and ship placement (for example, let's
   assume the second player is Bob).

1. With this starting info in hand, your game should begin the first player's
   turn
   - At the start of a turn, your game should indicate whose turn it is (e.g.,
     `Click OK to begin Alice's turn`).
   - After the turn information is dismissed, your game should render 2 10x10
     grids, one clearly labeled as the current player's ship placements, the
     other clearly labeled as the current player's target (i.e., information
     about the other player's ship placements).
     - Both grids should have a light blue background.
     - At the start of the first player's first turn, the target grid will
       be completely empty, and their grid will show only the location of
       the first player's ships
       - On the current player's grid, each space occupied by part of an
         aircraft carrier should contain an `A`, each space occupied by
         part of a battleship should contain a `B`, each space occupied by
         part of a submarine should contain an `S`.
   - The player is then free to click a space in the target grid to "fire" at.
     - Clicks on their own grid should have no effect.
     - The game should produce an overlay to inform the player whether the
       shot was a hit or a miss.
       - The CSS
         [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
         property may prove helpful in displaying this overlay.
       - If the player clicks on a space where no part of any of the other
         player's ships was placed, the shot is a miss, and the space
         should be colored white.
       - If some part of one of the other player's ships was placed in the
         clicked space, the shot is a hit, and the space should be colored
         red.
         - If this hit represents the final portion of a ship (i.e., the
           5th hit on an aircraft carrier, the 4th hit on a battleship,
           or the 3rd hit on a submarine), the player should be notified
           as to which of the other player's ships they have sunk.
     - If the player would attempt to fire at the same spot twice (e.g.,
       clicking a spot that was already marked hit or miss), they should be
       informed that such a selection is invalid and asked to try again.
   - After the player has clicked on their target space and the hit or miss
     has been reported, the player's turn is ended and the other player's turn
     should begin via a notification (e.g., `Click to begin Bob's turn`).
     - Note that this will require "blanking" the page to prevent Bob from
       seeing Alice's ship placement (and vice-versa), and will require a
       rearranging of the page after the notification is dismissed (e.g., so
       that Bob's target and ship placement grids appear in the positions
       where Alice's had been previously).

1. At any point in time, a player's target grid should display all the hits
   (red spaces) and misses (white spaces) that they have fired, while their ship
   placement grid shows all of the hits and misses their opponents have fired
   along with their own ship placements.

1. The game continues until all of one player's ships have been sunk, at which
   point the other player wins the game.
   - Once a winner has been established, your game should compute and present
     both players' scores:
     - Score is computed as: 24 - (2 points for each hit against them)
       - -10 points for having the aircraft carrier sunk
       - -8 points for having the battleship sunk
       - -6 points for having the submarine sunk
       - If Alice won the game while Bob was able to sink her submarine (3
         hits) and land a single hit on her battle ship, but did not hit
         her aircraft carrier at all, Alice's score would be 16
         - 24 - (2 \* 4)

1. Some automated tests are provided in `App.test.jsx`. They are implemented
   using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
   You will need to be sure that your project is written so that test like this
   can run (e.g., labelling the initial setup fields correctly, labelling
   the grids so that they can be detected and "clicked" by the test harness,
   refer to `App.test.jsx` for details).

1. For this project, you are not allowed to use any extra JavaScript libraries
   aside from those listed in the provided `package.json`. You must implement all
   of this functionality using React. All of your game UI should be created using
   React function components. You _cannot_ use `alert()` or `prompt()`. All of your
   game state must be stored using React Hooks.

## Submission Guidelines:

- **DO NOT SUBMIT** any IDE package files.

- The TA will run your game using the Vite scripts. Specifically running the
  following in the root of this directory:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
  - `npm run test:run`

- You must fill out `INFO_SHEET.txt`.

- Be sure to remember to push the latest copy of your code back to your GitHub
  repository before submitting. To submit, log into GradeScope and
  have GradeScope pull your repository from GitHub. **Simply pushing changes to GitHub and not submitting to Gradescope will not count as a submission, you need to have Gradescope pull the changes from GitHub.**

## Additional Notes/Hints:

- Your game does not need to persist across page refreshes. It is acceptable
  for a page refresh to restart the game.

- While you are not going to be heavily graded on the style and design of your
  game, it should be presented in a clear and readable manner.

- Your project submissions will be tested using a recent version of Google
  Chrome.

## Grading Rubric:

| Feature                                     | Points |
| ------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| Turns proceed as described                  |    25% |
| Game boards are displayed properly          |    30% |
| Event handling is processed as described    |    25% |
| Ship placement strings are correctly parsed |    10% |
| Clear and readable presentation             |     5% |
